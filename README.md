# 6.945-Project

As a project for a software systems class, a classmate (https://github.com/hizamianuar) and I created an "argument checker" in Scheme. The system allows a user to define arbitrary rules of inference in a user-defined language after which the user can submit a list of sentences in that language as an argument and the system will enumerate the inference steps that would need to be taken to deduce each line of the argument while assuming as few premises as possible. The system is incredibly flexible and the same instance can operate on multiple languages. In the code example, we demonstrated this by implementing the rules of monadic predicate calculus as well as a few toy natural language inference rules in the same system. The system is then able to derive arguments in either language.
